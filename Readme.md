# Bootstrap for ReasonReact

Heavily inspired by https://reactstrap.github.io/

Some handy links

## Examples

See `app.re` for an example of how to use this code.

Run `yarn start` to compile and see the example page.

## Todo

There is still quite a bit left to do, but someone could find some value in what currently exists.
* Make the Modal work properly
* Add Animations where applicable
    * Modal
    * Fade
* Add missing components
    * Dropdowns
    * Fade
    * Collapse
    * Tabs
    * Tooltips
    * Tables
    * Popovers
    * Media
    * Input Groups
* Make sure the apis for Col work well enough.
* Add missing callbacks. onClick, onChange etc.
* Pay attention for abstraction opportunities.
* Get away from reason-scripts. While it works for now, I don't think it is the correct solution for a library.
* Package for distrabution through NPM.
* More examples to flex the functionality and demostrate how the items work.
